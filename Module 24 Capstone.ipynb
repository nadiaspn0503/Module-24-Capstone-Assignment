    "The datasets are from the Goodreads Book Grapgh Datasets. The ratings.csv dataset consists of ratings given to various books by Goodreads users. The books.csv dataset provides information about each book that is rated including the title, original publication year, ISBN, average rating, and more. These datasets can be found [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/goodreads.html#datasets) Goodreads has asked for the following citations to be provided upon use:\n",

    "It should be noted that the original datasets from the Goodreads website provided above were too large to load onto my computer. Therefore, I am using modified versions of the datasets from the GitHub user zygmuntz through their goodbooks-10k repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). The ratings.csv and books.csv datasets are what I will use. It should be noted that the modifications to the datasets are necessary for modeling. To be specific, the original ratings dataset consisted of Goodreads-specific user and book IDs. The modified ratings dataset gives a more uniform identification to the books and users. These identification numbers were provided by Goodreads with the purpose of being combined and added to the ratings dataset.\n",

The recommendation system ensures that the Goodreads site fulfills its purpose and gives each user unique book recommendations that they will actually enjoy. Goodreads must figure out what type of recommendation system is best for predicting the best recommendations for each user. Using recommendation systems to determine the best model, Goodreads will be able to create unique and accurate algorithms for each user. This would increase customer retention and encourage more people to join Goodreads as accurate recommendations will encourage book readers to use this website to find and share books. "
